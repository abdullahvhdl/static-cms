      Welcome to our static CMS! This guide will help you get started with creating and managing your content.

      ## What is a Static CMS?

      A static CMS is a content management system that generates static websites. Unlike traditional CMSs that rely on databases and server-side processing, static CMSs create pre-built HTML files that can be served quickly and securely.

      ## Key Features

      - **Fast Performance**: Static sites load quickly since there's no database queries
      - **High Security**: No server-side vulnerabilities or database attacks
      - **Easy Deployment**: Deploy anywhere that serves static files
      - **Version Control**: Track changes with Git
      - **Cost Effective**: Minimal hosting requirements

      ## Getting Started

      1. **Create Your Content**: Use the admin panel to add new pages
      2. **Choose Templates**: Select from home, listing, or detail page templates
      3. **Configure YAML**: Edit the YAML configuration for advanced customization
      4. **Preview**: View your changes in real-time
      5. **Deploy**: Export your static files for deployment

      ## Template Types

      ### Home Page
      The home page template displays a grid of cards, perfect for navigation or showcasing key sections of your site.

      ### Listing Page
      Listing pages show a collection of links or items, ideal for blog post lists, portfolios, or resource collections. Links can be:
      - **Internal relative links** (like `/blog/post-title` or `/portfolio/project`)
      - **External absolute links** (like `https://example.com`)

      ### Detail Page
      Detail pages are perfect for blog posts, articles, or any content that needs a full page layout with rich text content.

      ## Tips for Success

      - Keep your content organized with clear categories
      - Use descriptive slugs for better SEO
      - Optimize images for web performance
      - Regular backup your YAML configuration
      - Mix internal and external links in listing pages as needed

      Happy content creating!
